    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I've worked in the banking industry for a couple of years. While I love what I've done and everything that I've learned. I decided it was time for a change. I'm a curious one so, I enjoy learning new things, creating new things, and especially  something that is going to challenge me.</p>
      <p>I began my coding adventure with Thinkful and I couldn't be happier. I've met and learned a lot from my peers and my mentor. I'm better prepared to becoming a software developer and I couldn't be more excited!</p>
      <p>If you're fresh on the scene or just looking to hire a new developer, feel free to reach out to me. I'm excited to meet and work with other developers.</p>
